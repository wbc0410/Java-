Last month, we had finished Java environment installing when we started a project to help our ads agents to predict the performance of ads when put on our advertising system.

Our domain was building a model to predict performance by finishing some Tensorflow scripts in Python. 
When we finished modeling, we still found some gaps between the online system and offline model training.
If we want to use our model to do some online prediction for business, we need to use Java programming skills to get features from other interfaces and then make a request to other servers.

During this project, I had realized how important Java is. Not only it could help us to request other servers, it could also help us to do some processing when we returned prediction results from the model requests.
After that, we had installed IDEA, JDK and finish the MAC environment setting for Java.
